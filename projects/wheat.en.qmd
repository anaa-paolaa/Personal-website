During my masterâ€™s thesis and my first job in Europe, I worked with one of its most iconic staple foods: **wheat**. My years in wheat research gave me much more than scientific resultsâ€”they gave me **R**.

**The mission:** analyze agro-climatic, sensor-based data and genetic data to understand plant resilience and improve grain yield.\

These projects taught me that data is never abstractâ€”it is the key to rethinking and adapting our food systems in the face of climate change.
