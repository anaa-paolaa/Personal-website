Exploring **Data Storytelling**, I chose to work with data from Madagascar—the country where I currently live. One of the most alarming environmental issues here is **deforestation**, which is not just a matter of numbers but a threat to biodiversity, communities, and the future of the island.

As part of a Tableau course (available at Coursera, there is a lot of options there actually...), I built **interactive dashboards** to visualize tree cover loss across time and regions.\

**The goal:** raise awareness of Madagascar’s dramatic forest loss.

This project showed me how **data visualization can tell stories** that move beyond statistics—inviting reflection, and hopefully, inspiring action.
