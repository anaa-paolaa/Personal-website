Freelance projects sometimes push you into new worlds—mine brought me to computer vision.

With a fruit producer company in Mexico, I have been working on building an image analysis pipeline in Python for a guava breeding program.\

The challenge: create an automated system to measure, analyze, and classify different guava traits.\

Along the way, I discovered tools I’d never heard of before as [PlantCV](https://plantcv.org/) (open-source image analysis software package, specifically for plant science) and I have been increasing my abilities in Python.

It’s been a winding road, but one that taught me how versatile data can be when combined with image analysis and -of course - creativity.
