We’re wrapping up the year with a project that was both challenging, motivating, and truly rewarding. My first training as the coach (hopefully, the first one from many others to come).

It was a statistics training called ***Stats sans stress***, because statistics are not meant to stress us out — they’re meant to **help us make sense of data**.

The training took place in Antsirabe, Madagascar, with technical evaluation officers from APDRA (*Association Pisciculture et Développement Rural in Africa*).

We worked on data management and cleaning, as well as the foundations of essential statistical tests, always tailored to the group’s real needs. We explored lots of fish-related data 🐟 and dove into this fascinating world to turn numbers into clear, meaningful stories backed by solid statistics.

Because data do tell stories — and learning how to read them can be both **useful and fun**.

If you’d like to learn how to work with data in a clear, useful, and stress-free way with your team, feel free to get in touch.
