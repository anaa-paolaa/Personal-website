    "text": "Exploring Data Storytelling, I chose to work with data from Madagascar—the country where I currently live. One of the most alarming environmental issues here is deforestation, which is not just a matter of numbers but a threat to biodiversity, communities, and the future of the island.\nAs part of a Tableau course (available at Coursera, there is a lot of options there actually…), I built interactive dashboards to visualize tree cover loss across time and regions.\n\nThe goal: raise awareness of Madagascar’s dramatic forest loss.\nThis project showed me how data visualization can tell stories that move beyond statistics—inviting reflection, and hopefully, inspiring action."

    "section": "",
    "text": "We’re wrapping up the year with a project that was both challenging, motivating, and truly rewarding. My first training as the coach (hopefully, the first one from many others to come).\nIt was a statistics training called Stats sans stress, because statistics are not meant to stress us out — they’re meant to help us make sense of data.\nThe training took place in Antsirabe, Madagascar, with technical evaluation officers from APDRA (Association Pisciculture et Développement Rural in Africa).\nWe worked on data management and cleaning, as well as the foundations of essential statistical tests, always tailored to the group’s real needs. We explored lots of fish-related data 🐟 and dove into this fascinating world to turn numbers into clear, meaningful stories backed by solid statistics.\nBecause data do tell stories — and learning how to read them can be both useful and fun.\nIf you’d like to learn how to work with data in a clear, useful, and stress-free way with your team, feel free to get in touch."

    "text": "Freelance projects sometimes push you into new worlds—mine brought me to computer vision.\nWith a fruit producer company in Mexico, I have been working on building an image analysis pipeline in Python for a guava breeding program.\n\nThe challenge: create an automated system to measure, analyze, and classify different guava traits.\n\nAlong the way, I discovered tools I’d never heard of before as PlantCV (open-source image analysis software package, specifically for plant science) and I have been increasing my abilities in Python.\nIt’s been a winding road, but one that taught me how versatile data can be when combined with image analysis and -of course - creativity."

    "text": "During my master’s thesis and my first job in Europe, I worked with one of its most iconic staple foods: wheat. My years in wheat research gave me much more than scientific results—they gave me R.\nThe mission: analyze agro-climatic, sensor-based data and genetic data to understand plant resilience and improve grain yield.\n\nThese projects taught me that data is never abstract—it is the key to rethinking and adapting our food systems in the face of climate change.\n📄 I’ve published some scientific articles that you can explore here:\nFrontiers paper"

I’m a woman of many passions, led by creativity, logic, and the joy of transformation.\nHere I share some of them, so you can get to know me better.\n\nData analysisBio & techContinous LearningHobbies\n\n\nCuriosity didn’t kill the cat—for me, exploring is a necessity. I love seeing how digging into data can turn into knowledge, clearer decisions, and better understanding.\nMy expertise lies in programming, statistics, and data reproducibility, which I’ve practiced across international projects, from genomics to image analysis. I’ve developed skills in multiple programming languages (R, Python, SQL) and visualization tools (Tableau, Shiny, Quarto) and I love data challenges.\n\n\nWith a degree in Biotechnology and a Master’s in Plant Breeding, my most recent projects have been linked to agriculture and, more broadly, to innovation and technology.\nAdvances in tech can be both inspiring and risky, which is why I enjoy staying informed, learning how to make better use of technologies, reflecting on ethics, and exploring how we can move forward together.\n\n\nI love learning—both in science and in life. From languages (I speak Spanish, English, French, Italian, and now a bit of Malagasy) to geography.\nI also love exploring new cultures and places, that’s what brought me to Mada in the 1st place.\n\n\nMy hobbies include dancing, painting, sports, and reading. I enjoy challenging myself with new things, right now it’s volleyball and diving.\n\n\n\n\nLet’s connect!"
